<h1>Hi, I'm Raihan! <br/>This is my Portfolio Project for Data Analyst/Scientist</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

There are several projects that i want to show the first one is data exploration in SQL Server, the second one is data visualization with Tableau, the third one is data cleaning in SQL Server, and the last one is finding correlation in data with python pandas. I will tell you more about each project below.

<h2>1. SQL Data Exploration</h2>

In this project i want to learn more about the data using SQL query, the data that i use is about covid, i got the data from kaggle here is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">link</a> for the data. I divide the table into two using excel the first one is death case and the second is vaccination. Next, i import the excel table to SQL server, and then I do some queries to learn about the data here is my <a href="https://github.com/Raihanp02/DataAnalysis-Project/blob/main/SQLQuery1.sql">SQL code</a>.

<h2>2. Tableau Visualization</h2>

This project consist of two things first is gathering data using SQL and the second is making the dashboard, so first i make four seperate tables in SQL and export it to xlsx format, here is the SQL code i use to make the four seperate table <a href="https://github.com/Raihanp02/DataAnalysis-Project/blob/main/SQLQuery1.sql">(SQL code)</a>. And after that i connect each table to tableau and begin to make the dashboard, here is my final <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/raihan.pahlevi/viz/DataAnalysis_dashboard/Dashboard1">dashboard</a>. 

<h2>3. Data Cleaning in SQL</h2>

The data that i use for this project is about housing sales data, here is the link for the <a href="https://github.com/Raihanp02/DataAnalysis-Project/blob/main/exceldata/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx">data</a>. and after that i begin to clean the data, you can see the details in my <a href="https://github.com/Raihanp02/DataAnalysis-Project/blob/main/SQLdatacleaning.sql">SQL code</a>.

<h2>4. Correlation in Python</h2>

This project is my most favorite one because i love using pandas in python. so in this project i use the data about movies here if you want to see the <a href="https://github.com/Raihanp02/DataAnalysis-Project/blob/main/exceldata/movies.csv">data</a>. And then first i clean the data with pandas so the data is more usable, and after that i start to analyse the gross column correlation using seaborn and numpy. The details is in my code <a href="https://github.com/Raihanp02/DataAnalysis-Project/blob/main/pythoncode.ipynb">here</a>.
